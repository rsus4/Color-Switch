## About the Project 🌌
This is our take on the hit game that was on every other phone a few years back. The objective of the game is to collect stars (that can be used to revive the player and buy perks) while avoiding the fast moving obstancles. The color of the ball keeps changing and more and more difficult obstancles are introduced as the player progresses. After losing, the player can be revived for some coins or by watching a video.


We have added two modes- the classic 'classic mode' and our 'frenzy mode'. The classic mode is very similar to the original game, while the (aptly titled) frenzy mode lands the player in a new environment with low visibility, weaker gravity and rapidly increasing speed. We have also added a few new features like a ball shop with balls of different sizes, an option to use a headstart, a competitive leaderboard, and support for multiple users with multiple user login. Have fun!
